# Bank-Application
A bank application built from Java using Eclipse and a DB Browser(SQLite) database. It performs the same functions as a normal banking application (depositing, withdrawing, transferring, etc.) using hypothetical money. It also incorporates a registration and login system, and an interface for both admin and customer banking accounts.
