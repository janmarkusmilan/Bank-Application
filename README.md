# Bank-Application
A bank application built from Java using Eclipse and a DB Browser(SQLite) database. It performs the same functions as a normal banking application (depositing, withdrawing, transferring, etc.) using hypothetical money. It also incorporates a registration and login system, and an interface for both admin and customer banking accounts.

In order to run the project, please:
  1. Download the project folder
  2. Run Eclipse and DB Browser for SQLite
  3. Run Login.java in the source folder and use the credentials in "Bank Accounts.db"
  4. You can also run Registration.java and create an account there, rather than accessing a pre-existing account
